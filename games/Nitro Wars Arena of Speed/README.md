# Pitch
A simple combat racing game where players race on shifting tracks while collecting power-ups and using combat abilities in order to sabotage opponents.

Key Mechanics
- **Dynamic Arena Tracks** - The racing track is either procedurally generated or changes during play and includes new obstacles or shortcuts.
- **Boost & Nitro System**: Players gather Nitro through doing stunts or barely avoiding collision courses to spend on boosting. 
- **Combat Racing**: Light attack mechanics like EMP and missiles make the process of disrupting opponents easy. 
- **Track Hazards**: Sometimes the track features randomly appearing obstacles such as moving walls or traps that affect racing.
- **Power-ups & Upgrades** - While racing, pick up items that give the performance of your vehicle for instance a speed boost, shield, or missile upgrades.

# Core Game Loop
1. **Enter the Arena** - The player selects a character or vehicle to race and prepares for launch. 
2. **Race & Survive** - Make one's way around a dynamically shifting track while dodging obstacles and attacking opponents.
3. **Boost & Attack** - Run and collect Nitro to overtake or defend. 
4. **Watch out for Hazard & Track Change** - Sometimes, the track changes, exposing more obstacles or yielding a new route.
5. **Finish Race or Upgrade** - Finish the race, get the reward, and then buy more capable vehicles or upgrades with that.

# Keep Players Engaged
**Game Modes**: Classic races and "Last Racer Standing" mode.
**Progressive System**: Vehicle and Track unlocks. 
**Dynamic Challenges**: No two races will ever be the same with randomly generated tracks and other hazards. 
**Leaderboards**: Records of the best times or wins in the different modes.
