# Easy Peasy

**Team Members:** jo9182


**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

Grow a garden, harass your neighbors, and crush other kids' dreams! Live out your lifelong fantasy of running your very own suburban juice stand!!


**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Growing your garden and making drinks from the fruits and vegetables you harvest. Dealing with opposing stands would also be fun.


**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Players grow and maintain their own garden using the money they get from selling drinks made from the fruits and veggies they grow. Your goal is to be the best juice stand on the block... by all means necessary. So, as you could likely determine from what I said earlier, other juice stands will undercut your prices and take your business. You can deal with them by either genuinely competing or by... dealing with their stand. Your primary goal is to expand your stand and to discover more plants and drinks.


**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

I first plan on introducing basic mechanics. The tutorial will be mostly guided with arrows and circles; it will introduce juicing fruits and filling cups. After that, the player will be introduced to farming and harvesting fruits. Once the player successfully does all of the tutorials, they will be cut loose with a small allowance to start off with. Once the player manages to get their second fruit or vegetable, they will be introduced to the wonderful world of blending the fruits and veggies together to make new drinks. They'll also be introduced to other stands after they learn how to combine and will be taught how to handle other stands via TPing the opposing stand.
